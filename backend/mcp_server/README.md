# Voicebox MCP server

Local **Model Context Protocol** server — lets any MCP-aware agent
(Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code MCP extensions, etc.) speak text
in your cloned voices, transcribe audio, and browse captures.

The server runs inside the same `uvicorn` process as the rest of Voicebox
and is mounted at `/mcp` (Streamable HTTP transport).

## Install into your agent

Preferred — direct HTTP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "voicebox": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:17493/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-Voicebox-Client-Id": "claude-code" }
    }
  }
}
```

Fallback — stdio shim (when the client doesn't speak HTTP MCP). The
`voicebox-mcp` binary ships inside the Voicebox.app bundle:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "voicebox": {
      "command": "/Applications/Voicebox.app/Contents/MacOS/voicebox-mcp",
      "env": { "VOICEBOX_CLIENT_ID": "claude-code" }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code one-liner:

```
claude mcp add voicebox \
  --transport http \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:17493/mcp \
  --header "X-Voicebox-Client-Id: claude-code"
```

## Tools

| Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `voicebox.speak`          | Speak text in a voice profile. Returns a generation id you can poll. |
| `voicebox.transcribe`     | Whisper transcription of a base64 blob or an absolute local path. |
| `voicebox.list_captures`  | Recent captures (dictation / recording / file) with transcripts. |
| `voicebox.list_profiles`  | Available voice profiles (cloned + preset). |
| `voicebox.analyze_sample` | Analyze a voice sample's cloning suitability. Pass `audio_base64` or `audio_path` + `reference_text`. |

All tools resolve voice profiles in this precedence:

1. Explicit `profile` arg (name or id — case-insensitive)
2. Per-client binding keyed by `X-Voicebox-Client-Id`
3. `capture_settings.default_playback_voice_id` (global default)

Bindings are managed via `GET|PUT /mcp/bindings` or in the app under
Settings → MCP.

### voicebox.analyze_sample examples

Pass audio as base64 bytes (works from any MCP client):

```json
{
  "profile_id": "abc-123",
  "reference_text": "今天天气真好，阳光洒在窗台上...",
  "audio_base64": "//uQxAAAAAANIAAAAAE..."
}
```

Or pass a local file path (loopback callers only — Claude Code, local stdio):

```json
{
  "profile_id": "abc-123",
  "reference_text": "今天天气真好，阳光洒在窗台上...",
  "audio_path": "/Users/me/recordings/sample.wav"
}
```

Returns the quality report:

```json
{
  "passed": true,
  "score": 0.85,
  "duration_seconds": 12.3,
  "issues": [],
  "warnings": ["录音时长可接受（12.3秒），但10秒以上效果更佳"],
  "metrics": {
    "duration_seconds": 12.3,
    "rms": 0.0821,
    "clip_ratio": 0.001,
    "speech_fraction": 0.92,
    "snr_db": 28.5
  }
}
```

The `passed` field is `false` when issues exist (too short, too quiet, too
much silence). Check `issues` for blocking problems and `warnings` for
suggestions. The `score` is a 0-1 quality estimate suitable for threshold
gates in agent workflows.

## Debug with MCP Inspector

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector http://127.0.0.1:17493/mcp
```

Point it at the URL, hit "List tools," call `voicebox.list_profiles`
first to confirm wiring, then `voicebox.speak` for end-to-end.

## Non-MCP REST surface

`POST /speak` is a thin wrapper on the same code path for callers that
don't speak MCP (shell scripts, ACP, A2A):

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:17493/speak \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Voicebox-Client-Id: claude-code' \
  -d '{"text":"Build complete.","profile":"Morgan"}'
```

```

The package is **`mcp_server`**, not `mcp`, to avoid shadowing the
installed `mcp` PyPI package that FastMCP imports internally.
